# Learnability and Semantic Universals
## (quantifier-rnn-learning)

This repository accompanies the following paper:
* Steinert-Threlkeld and Szymanik 2018, "Learnability and Semantic Universals", under revision at _Semantics & Pragmatics_. https://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/mQ2Y2Y2Z/LearnabilitySemanticUniversals.pdf

In particular, we attempt to explain semantic universals surrounding quantifiers by training a recurrent neural network (a long-short term memory network specifically) to learn quantifiers, some satisfying proposed universals and some not.  Generally, we find that those satisfying universals are easier to learn by this model than those that do not.  

This repository contains all the code needed to replicate the experiments reported in that paper.  It also contains the data and figures from the experiments that we ran and which are reported therein.
